# Music_Composition_YVIP_Hackathon

## Overview
This was my winning submission for the Your Voice is Power National Hacakthon. Through this project I was able to use my Phython coding skills to compose music representing Indigienous voices. To listen to the song you can click [here](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/?sharing=7k3TekUBjC9SeGF3rjdgZg).

## What I used:
To compose the music I used Earsketch, where all the sounds were preuploaded, and I used Python to peice sound togther, and construct a complete song.
